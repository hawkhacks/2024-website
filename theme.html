  <h2>HawkHacks 2024 Theme: UN SDGs 1, 5, 7, 8</h2>
  <p>
    This year's HawkHacks theme revisits our 2021 theme of the <span class="highlight"> United Nationâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals,</span> which aim to ensure global equality and sustainability by 2030. 
    <br>
    Teams will pick and create a tech solution focused on advancing one* of the following four SDGs and solve computational problems related to all of them.
    <br>
    <br>
    Teams will then prototype and present a tech-based solution for their chosen SDG, with help from workshops, programming materialss, and professional mentors. Solutions will be scored on potential impact towards achieving the SDG, originality, technological sophistication and feasibility, and planned next steps.
