			<h2>History</h2>
			<p> In 2017, members of a Hunter College High School club called Code 4 Change held the original HawkHacks.
				It was a day-long hacking and coding event held at Hunter College High School. During the COVID-19
				pandemic, another HCHS club called Hunter Data Analytics for Change—whose board includes one original
				member of C4C—revived the competition and hosted HawkHacks 2021!
				</br>
				</br>
				With HawkHacks 2024, HawkHacks is now in its <span class="highlight">5th year!</span>
