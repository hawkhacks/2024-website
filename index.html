                <h2>What is HawkHacks?</h2>
                <p>
                    HawkHacks is an international virtual hackathon for middle
                    and high school students on
                    <span class="highlight"> Saturday, May 25th,</span> and
                    <span class="highlight">Sunday, May 26th</span>. Make teams
                    of up to four people (individuals welcome!) and get ready
                    for a weekend full of brainstorming, coding, and pitching.

                    <br /><br />
                    Hawkhacks will consist of two segments:
                    <br /><br />

                    <span class="highlight">Ideathon:</span> You will have the
                    weekend (both days) to build a coding-related solution
                    related to a given problem, meet with expert mentors, and
                    develop a pitch. <br /><br />
                    <span class="highlight">Capture the flag:</span> On Sunday
                    you will be given a set of competitive-coding style problems
                    themed towards our chosen social issues. <br /><br />

                    The top performers accross both segments will be declared
                    the winners! Registration is open! (Note: at least one team
                    member must be 13 or older to sign up for HawkHacks.) Email <span class="highlight">hchs.hawkhacks@gmail.com</span> with any questions.
